# Python - The Basics
### By Peter Sandberg

# Why learn and use python?

- It's extremely easy to write, read and understand
- It runs seamlessly across different operating systems
- It comes with an awesome package indexing system, as part of the standard installation (similar to apt-get for linux)
- There exists an endless amount of free, public python libraries, that can be installed in seconds using the package indexing system
- Most modern web services offer easy-to-use APIs towards python

# Outline

- "Hello world"
- Variables
- Numbers and math
- Collections
- Strings
- If-statements
- Loops
- Methods

# "Hello world"

Being able to print something to the console is always useful. In python, this is done using the 'print'-method


```python
print("Hello world")
```

    Hello world


We have now created our first python script! If you saved this as a .py-file and ran it in a terminal using 'python filename.py' you would get the output as shown above (no main-methods etc. needed) 

# Variables

The syntax for creating variables is extremely simple, and is done in the following way:

    variable_name = value
    

## Creating variables

When creating variables, you simply assign a value to them without specifying the type

The type will then be automatically inferred


```python
var1 = 1
var1 = "Hello world"
type(var1)
```




    str



You can also assign multiple variables in a single line


```python
var1, var2, var3 = "hello", 1, 2
var1
```




    'hello'



Or, you can assign multiple variables by unpacking a collection


```python
a_point = [1, 2]
x, y = a_point
x
```




    1



Because you do not specify the type of a variable when creating it, the type of a variable is not 'locket'. This means that the type of a particular varible may change throughout the script (although this is not recommended)


```python
var1 = "Hello world"
var1 = 1
var1 = 1.0
```

# Numbers

Three main types of numbers:
- **int**: integers
- **float**: floating-point numbers (decimal numbers)
- **complex**: complex numbers


```python
int_num = 1
float_num = 1.0
complex_num = complex(1, 1)
```

## Some built-in functions for numbers

Converting an integer to a float


```python
float(1)
```




    1.0



Converting a float to an integer


```python
int(1.0)
```




    1



Getting the absolute value of a number


```python
abs(-1)
```




    1



Rounding a floting-point number to the nearest integer (.5 will be rounded up)


```python
round(1.5)
```




    2



Getting the first integer lower than a floating-point number


```python
import math
math.floor(1.9)
```




    1



Getting the first integer larger than a floating-point number


```python
from math import ceil
ceil(1.9)
```




    2



## Mathematical operations

```python
1 + 2
```




    3



Subtracting


```python
2 - 1
```




    1



Multiplying


```python

```




    1



Exponentiating


```python
2 ** 4
```




    16



Taking the square root


```python
from math import sqrt
sqrt(9)
# Alternatively you can use x ** 0.5
```




    3.0



Taking the log


```python
from math import log
# The log10 of 100
log(100, 10)
```




    2.0



# Collections

The basic types of collections in python are:
- **list**: a mutable, ordered collection, with integer indices
- **tuple**: an immutable, ordered collection, with integer indices
- **set**: a mutable, unordered collection
- **dict**: a mutable, unordered collection with any hashable type as index

## Note about collections

- As with other types of collections, you do not need to specify the the types of the content that a collection should contain
- Therefore, any collection in Python may contain mixed types - which is often very useful


```python
["a", 1.0]
```




    ['a', 1.0]



# List

- A list is a mutable, ordered collection that can be indexed with integer values
- In Python, a list is created by using square brackets

## Initializing a list

Creating an empty list


```python
a_list = []
```

Or alternatively


```python
a_list = list()
a_list
```




    []



Creating a list with some initial values


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Indexing a list

The simplest form of indexing is done by using:

    list_name[index]

Lists in python are zero-indexed


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a_list[0]
```




    1



You can also use negative indices, to index from the end of the list; -1 will be the last item, -2 will be the second last item and so forth


```python
a_list[-1]
```




    5



Indices are also used to set values


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a_list[0] = 10
a_list
```




    [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]



## Multidimensional lists

To create a multidimensional list - just create another list inside the list


```python
a_2dim_list = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
```

To index a multidimensional list, just add more square-brackets with indices


```python
a_2dim_list[0][1]
```




    2



## Slicing a list

- If you want to index a subset of the list, slicing can be used. Slicing is done in the following way:

        list_name[start_index:end_index]
    
- This command will select all elements from (including) `start_index`, to (excluding) `end_index`
- Both `start_index` and `end_index` are optional parameters. Leaving them out will start slicing at the beginning of the list, or end the slicing at the end of the list, respectively.

Basic slicing


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a_list[1:]
```




    [2, 3, 4, 5]



- Slicing also acepts a third parameter - step - which is used to control the step length used when selecting items from the list. The syntax will then become:

        list_name[start_index:end_index:step]
    
- step = 2 will select every other element, step = 3 will select every third element, step = -1 will select backwards etc.

Slicing with step parameter


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
a_list[0:8:2]
```




    [1, 3, 5, 7]



### Using slicing to set values

Slicing can also be used to set a subset of a list


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
a_list[2:5] = [0,0,0,0]
a_list
```




    [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]



Or even cooler, to insert a list into another list


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a_list[2:2] = [0, 0, 0]
a_list
```




    [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5]



### Using slicing to copy a list

Slicing is also commonly used to make a copy of a list


```python
a_list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a_list2 = a_list1[:]
```


```python
a_list1 is a_list2
```




    False




```python
a_list1 == a_list2
```




    True



## Adding items to a list

**append(item)**: used to add an item to the end of the list


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
a_list.append(4)
a_list
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



**extend([item1, item2, ..])**: used to extend the list with values from another collection


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
a_list.extend([4, 5, 6])
a_list
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



**insert(i, item)**: used to insert an *item* at position *i* 


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 4]
a_list.insert(2, 3)
a_list
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4]



## Removing items from a list

**remove(item)**: used to remove a an *item* from the list


```python
a_list = [1, 2, "a"]
a_list.remove("a")
a_list
```




    [1, 2]



**pop(i)**: used to remove and return the item on position *i*


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3]
a_list.pop(0)
```




    1




```python
a_list
```




    [2, 3]



## Other useful list operations

**index(item)**: returns the index of the first occurence of `item`


```python
[1,2,3,4,5,3,3,3].index(3)
```




    2



**reverse()**: used to reverse the order of a list


```python
a_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
a_list.reverse()
a_list
```




    [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]



**sort()**: used to sort a list


```python
a_list = [3,1,2,5,4]
a_list.sort()
a_list
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



## Math on Lists

Adding together lists


```python
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



Multiplying lists


```python
[1, 2, 3] * 3
```




    [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]



## List comprehension

A very great feature in Python is list comprehension, which is a way of generating lists in a single line


```python
a_list = [[x for x in range(3)] for y in range(3)]
a_list
```




    [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]




```python
[x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```




    [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]



## Tuple

- Similar to a list, except that it is immutable (you cannot change its values)
- This means that all the methods used to modify a list will not work on a tuple
- However, indexing and slicing still works

## Initializing a tuple

Creating an empty tuple


```python
a_tuple = tuple()
```

Creating a tuple with some initial values


```python
a_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```

Creating a tuple with a single value


```python
a_tuple = (1,)
type(a_tuple)
```




    tuple



# Set

- A set is a mutable, unordered collection
- A set will not contain any duplicate items
    - This means that if you initialize a set with duplicates, they will be removed
    - Further, if you try to add an existing value to a set, the value will not be added

## Initializing a set

Creating an empty set


```python
a_set = set()
```

Although a set is printed with curly brackets, you cannot use the syntax

    a_set = {}
    
because this syntax is reserved for creating dictionaries

Creating a set with some initial values. Note that duplicates are automatically removed


```python
a_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 2}
a_set
```




    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}



Converting a list to a set


```python
a_list = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
a_set = set(a_list)
a_set
```




    {1, 2, 3}



# Adding items to a set


**add(item)**: used to add an item to the set


```python
a_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
a_set.add(6)
a_set
```




    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}



**update([item1, item2, ..])**: used to add several items to the set


```python
a_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
a_set.update([4, 5, 6, 7])
a_set
```




    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}



## Removing items from a set

**remove(item)**: used to remove an item from the set


```python
a_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
a_set.remove(1)
a_set
```




    {2, 3, 4, 5}



# Dictionaries

- Unordered colllection that axcepts any hashable value as an index
- The indices must be unique; setting an index that already exist will overwrite it

## Initializing a dictionary

Creating an empty dictionary


```python
a_dict = {}
```

Creating a dictionary with some initial values


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
```

## Retrieving items from a dictionary

This is done in the same way as for a list, except that the user-defined index is used


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
a_dict["a"]
```




    1



## Setting values in a dictionary

This is also done in the same way as for a list, except that any hashable object may be used as the index value


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
a_dict["d"] = 4
a_dict
```




    {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}



**setdefault(key, default_value)**: Setting value *only if it does not already exist*


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
a_dict.setdefault("c", 3)
a_dict.setdefault("a", 100)
a_dict
```




    {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}



## Removing items from a dictionary

**clear()**: removes all items from the dictionary


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
a_dict.clear()
a_dict
```




    {}



**pop(key)**: removes and returns the item with the given *key* from the dictionary


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
a_dict.pop("b")
```




    2




```python
a_dict
```




    {'a': 1, 'c': 3}



## Keys and values of a dict

To get the keys of a dict


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
list(a_dict.keys())
```




    ['b', 'c', 'a']



To get the values


```python
a_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
list(a_dict.values())
```




    [2, 3, 1]



# Other usefull built-in collection methods

**len(collection)**: returns the length of the collection


```python
len([1,2,3,4,5,5,5,5])
```




    8



**max(collection), min(collection)**: used to get the maximum and minimum value in a collection, respectively


```python
min([1,-1,10,0,5])
```




    -1



**sum(collection)**: sum all values in a collection


```python
sum([1,2,3,4,5])
```




    15



**the *in* operator**: To check if an element is *in* a collection


```python
"d" in ["a", "b", "c"]
```




    False




```python
"d" not in ["a", "b", "c"]
```




    True



## Sorting

Sorting a list


```python
sorted([0,1,2,3,4])
```




    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]



`sorted` also accepts a parameter called `key`, which must be a function that takes an item as input, and returns an integer value. A lower integer value means an eariler position in the sorted list. 

E.g. if you want to sort a list of tuples by the second number:


```python
a = [(1,5), (0,0), (2,3), (1,2), (4, 4), (9,6)]
sorted(a, key=lambda x: x[1])
```




    [(0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (1, 5), (9, 6)]



(more about lambda-functions later)

# Strings

- Strings, as in other languages, is the structure used to store textual data
- In Python, strings share a lot of common properties with collections

## Creating strings

Both double quotation marks (") and single quotation marks (') may be used when creating strings. If you use double quotation marks, single quotation marks may be used inside the string without escaping them (and vice versa)


```python
a_str = "Hello world"
a_str2 = 'Hello world'
```

You can also use 3 double quotation marks, if you need a multiline string


```python
a_str = """This string goes across
            two lines"""
```

## Adding to a string

To add to a string, use '+'


```python
a_str = "Hello my name is"
a_str += " Peter"
a_str
```




    'Hello my name is Peter'



## Accessing characters or substrings

Accessing specific characters or substrings works in the exact same way as indexing of lists


```python
"Hello world"[0]
```




    'H'




```python
"Hello world"[6:]
```




    'world'




```python
"Hello world"[::-1]
```




    'dlrow olleH'



## Some useful string methods

To check wether the string has some specific properties without iterating through each character:
- **isalnum()**: check if the string only contains alphanumeric characters
- **isdigit()**: check if the string only contains digits
- **islower()**: check if the string is only lower-case letters

... and [many more](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html)


```python
"12345".isdigit()
```




    True



**lower()**, **upper()**: used to convert the text to all lower-case or all upper-case 


```python
"This Should Be Lowered".lower()
```




    'this should be lowered'



**split(sep)**: split the text on the separating character `sep`. The separating character will not be part of the returned result


```python
"Hello my name is Peter".split(" ")
```




    ['Hello', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'Peter']



**join(collection)**: used to join the items of a collection using the given string


```python
a_list = ["Tic", "Tac", "Toe"]
", ".join(a_list)
```




    'Tic, Tac, Toe'



**strip()**: used to strip whitespace from the ends of the string (use rstrip or lstrip to strip from only one end)


```python
"            Hello               \n\n".strip()
```




    'Hello'



**replace(str_a, str_b)**: replace all occurances of the string `str_a` with the string `str_b`


```python
"This is cool".replace("s", "z")
```




    'Thiz iz cool'



# If-statements

The syntax for writing if-statements is:

    if some_condition:
        do_something()
    elif some_other_condition:
        do_something2()
    else:
        do_something3()
        
Note that the if-statement:
- may have no else-statements
- may have no, or more than one elif-statement

## The two boolean values

In Python, the boolean values are written with a capitalized first letter. The two boolean values are therefore:
- `True` 
- `False`


```python
peter_is_a_programming_ninja = True
```

## Boolean operators


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Operator</th>
    <th>What it is used for</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>==</td>
    <td>Checking for value equality</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>!=</td>
    <td>Checking for value inequality</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>is</td>
    <td>Checking for object equality</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;, &lt;</td>
    <td>Greather than, less than</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&gt;=, &lt;=</td>
    <td>Greater than or equal, less than or equal</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>not</td>
    <td>Used to negate an boolean expression</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>and, or</td>
    <td>Used to combine boolean expressions</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The precedence of the boolean operators follow normal boolean algebra

## Example If-statement


```python
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3

if x <= 2 and (y != 2 or z > 0):
    print("This happened")
elif z + 1 >= 4:
    print("This should not happen")
else:
    print("This happens if everything else fails")
```

    This happened


## Everything has a truth value

- A string evaluates to `True` unless it is blank
- A collection evaluates to `True` if it contains any items
- A number evaluates to `True` unless it is zero
- Any object evaluates to `True` unless it is `None`

When creating your own class, you can control the [truth value testing](https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/truth.html) of objects of this class.


```python
a_str = ""
if not a_str:
    print("The string is blank")
```

    The string is blank



```python
a_list = []
if not a_list:
    print("The list does not contain any values")
```

    The list does not contain any values



```python
a_number = 0.0
if not a_number:
    print("The number is zero")
```

    The number is zero



```python
a_obj = None
if not a_obj:
    print("The object is None")
```

    The object is None


## Boolean operators on complex objects

A cool thing in Python is that boolean operators may not only be used on the simple types, but also on complex types like collections. Further, if you implement a few methods in your custom classes, you can also compare these objects using the boolean operators


```python
if [1, 2, 3] < [1, 5, 6]:
    print("Woho")
```

    Woho



```python
if "Arne" < "Peter":
    print("Yey")
```

    Yey


# Loops

There are two types of loops in Python:
- for-each
- while

## For-each loops

For-each loops are created in Python in the following way:

    for x in something_iterable:
        do_something(x)
        
This will iterate over all items in `something_iterable`

## Iterating through a sequence of numbers

To iterate through an ordered sequence of numbers you can use the `range` method. The `range` method takes 1-3 parameters, depending on what you want to do:
- `range(x)`: iterate from 0 to (excluding) x
- `range(x,y)`: iterate from x to (excluding) y
- `range(x,y,z)`: iterate from x to (excluding) y, using step size z




```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4


## Iterating over a collection


Iterating over a list


```python
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(x)
```

    1
    2
    3


Iterating over a dictionary. This will iterate over the *keys* in the dictionary.


```python
for x in {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}:
    print(x)
```

    a
    c
    b


You can also iterate over *strings*. This will iterate over the characters.


```python
for c in "Hello":
    print(c)
```

    H
    e
    l
    l
    o


## Automatic unpacking in a for-loop

Lets say that you have a list of tuples (x, y)


```python
list_of_tup = [("a", 1), ("b", 2), ("c", 3)]
```

You wold like to iterate over the list and select x and y as variables. One way to achieve this would be:


```python
for tup in list_of_tup:
    x, y = tup
    print("x={}, y={}".format(x,y))
```

    x=a, y=1
    x=b, y=2
    x=c, y=3


However, recall from the section about variables that python provides automatic unpacking of collections


```python
a_collection = [1, 2, 3]
var1, var2, var3 = a_collection
var1
```




    1



This type of unpacking also works when iterating over a collection of collections, e.g. a list of tuples!


```python
for x, y in list_of_tup:
    print("x={}, y={}".format(x,y))
```

    x=a, y=1
    x=b, y=2
    x=c, y=3


In combination with the built-in `zip` method, automatic unpacking becomes very useful when you want to iterate over two or more collections of the same length, simultaneously


```python
collection1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
collection2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x, y in zip(collection1, collection2):
    print("x={}, y={}".format(x,y))
```

    x=a, y=1
    x=b, y=2
    x=c, y=3


Some times it is useful to be able to iterate over an ordered collection, and get the indices and values as separate variables. For this purpose, python as a built-in method called `enumerate`


```python
collection1 = ["my", "name", "is", "bob"]

for i, x in enumerate(collection1):
    print("{} - {}".format(i, x))
```

    0 - my
    1 - name
    2 - is
    3 - bob


# While loops

While loops are created in the following way:

    while some_condition:
        do_something()

This means that, as long as `some_condition` evaluates to True, `do_something()` should be executed 


```python
x = 0
while x < 3:
    x += 1
    print(x)
```

    1
    2
    3


# Interrupting loops

To break the loop - use `break`


```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        break
    print(i)
```

    0
    1
    2


To skip an iteration of a loop - use `continue`


```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

    0

# Methods

- Just as everything else, the syntax for creating methods in Python is very simple
- Although the syntax is simple, methods in Python are really powerfull, if you know how to use them
- Methods in Python **do not need to belong to a specific class**
    - This means that, for many purposes, you do not need to create classes at all
- All methods in Python **are objects**. This means that:
    - They can be assigned to variables
    - They can be passed as arguments to other methods

## Defining methods

The most basic way of defining a method is:

    def some_function(param1, param2, param3 ...):
        do_something()
        return something

Some notes:
- Since variables in Python do not have specified types, you do not specify the types of the method parameters either
- You do not specify the return type of a method

## Some simple methods

A simple "void" method


```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, {}!".format(name))
    
greet("Bob")
```

    Hello, Bob!


A method with a single return value


```python
def square(x):
    return x**2

square(3)
```




    9



## Multiple return values

A very useful feature in Python is that a method can have multiple return values, without you having to specify some special structure to return multiple values


```python
def get_next_char_and_number(character, number):
    next_character = chr(ord(character)+1)
    next_number = number + 1
    return next_character, next_number

get_next_char_and_number("a", 1)
```




    ('b', 2)



Combined with "automatic unpacking", this becomes even more useful


```python
next_character, next_number = get_next_char_and_number("a", 1)
next_number
```




    2



## The different types of method parameters

- Required parameters
- Optional parameters
- Variable-length parameters
- Keyworded, variable-length parameters

## Optional parameters

You may define parameters as optional, by giving them a default value:
    
    def some_function(param1, ..., opt_param=default_value):
        do_something()



```python
def greet1(first_name, last_name=""):
    print("Hello, {} {}".format(first_name, last_name))
```


```python
greet1("Peter", "Sandberg")
```

    Hello, Peter Sandberg



```python
greet1("Peter")
```

    Hello, Peter 


## Variable-length parameters

In some cases you want to call a method with a varying number of parameters. For this purpose, you can use a star (`*`) in front of the parameter name, to say that the parameter consists of 0 or more values:

    def some_function(*args):
        do_something()


```python
def greet2(*names):
    if names:
        names_str = ""
        if len(names) == 1:
            names_str = names[0]
        else:
            names_str = ", ".join(names[:-1]) + " and " + names[-1]
        print("Hello " + names_str)
```


```python
greet2("Huey", "Dewey", "Louie")
```

    Hello Huey, Dewey and Louie


## Keyworded, variable-length parameters

Some times you want a varying number of parameters, and you also want these parameters to be labled. To achieve this, you would use two stars (`**`) in front of the parameter name, to say that a varying number of labeled parameters will be given:

    def some_function(**kwargs):
        do_something()


```python
def greet3(**name):
    if name:
        name_str = ""
        if "title" in name:
            name_str += name["title"] + " "
        if "first_name" in name:
            name_str += name["first_name"] + " "
        if "last_name" in name:
            name_str += name["last_name"]
        print("Hello " + name_str)
```


```python
greet3(title="Dr", first_name="Phil")
```

    Hello Dr Phil 


## Combining parameters

Combining the different types of parameters is also possible. If you want to combine the different types of parameters, they must be listed in the following order:

1. Required parameters
2. Optional parameters
3. Variable-length parameters
4. Keyworded, variable-length parameters

Note that you may have multiple parameters of type (1) and (2), but only a single of type (3) and (4)

    def some_function(param1, param2, .., opt_param1=some_value, opt_param2=some_value, .., *args, **kwargs):
        do_something()

## Overloading in python?

In other programming languages like Java, you have the option to create several methods with the same name that take different arguments. In python, each method must have a unique name. However, you can still easily re-create this behaviour if necessary, e.g. by using the `isinstance` method to check the type of each paramerter.


```python
known_persons = ["Hewie", "Dewey", "Louie"]

# In this example x is either the id (number) of a person, or the name of the person
def greet4(x):
    if isinstance(x, int):
        if 0 <= x < len(known_persons):
            print("Hello, {}".format(known_persons[x]))
    elif isinstance(x, str):
        print("Hello, {}".format(x))
```


```python
greet4(0)
```

    Hello, Hewie



```python
greet4("Peter")
```

    Hello, Peter


## Methods as objects

Recall that Python methods are objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables.


```python
def increment(x):
    return x + 1

def decrement(x):
    return x - 1
```


```python
a_func = decrement
a_func(1)
```




    0




```python
a_func = increment
a_func(1)
```




    2



### Passing methods to methods

Since methods are objects, you can also pass a method as an arguments to another method


```python
def combine_inputs(x, y, combine_func):
    return combine_func(x, y)
```


```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

combine_inputs(1, 4, add)
```




    5




```python
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

combine_inputs(2, 3, multiply)
```




    6



## Documenting methods

When doing professional development (or any other kind of development for that matter), you would like do do some in-line documentation. This can be achieved by placing a *string* right below the the method definition.

This documentation can then be accessed by using the `__doc__` attribute of the function. When using a Python IDE like PyCharm, this attribute will be accessed and presented when a user wants documentation of a particular function.


```python
def combine_inputs(x, y, combine_func):
    "Combine x and y using the combine_func method"
    return combine_func(x, y)

combine_inputs.__doc__ 
```




    'Combine x and y using the combine_func method'
